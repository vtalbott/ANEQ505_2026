#### Alpine Hardware:
- AMD Milan compute nodes
    - 64 cores / node
    - ~240 GB ram / node
    - An average laptop has around 4 cores & 8-16 GB ram, so each node is about 16X more powerful than your average laptop
- High memory AMD Milan compute nodes 
    - 48 cores / node
    - ~1 TB ram / node (😱)  
- Did this work?
